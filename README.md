### üí° What is it?

<b>Be The Hero</b> is a small app created to support financially non governamental organizations. It was part of the
11th Omnistack Week. An event sponsored by [Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat) as a way to teach and encourage
development with React and ReactJS technologies. This repository contains the back-end, front-end and also a mobile
version of the app.

### üèÜ Technologies used:

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
- [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Expo](https://expo.io/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/)
- [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
- [Cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors)

PS.: It's very important to notice that Expo simplified the deploying process of the app a lot!
